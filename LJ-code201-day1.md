<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>
<body>
<p>My day started great when the bus driver gave me a complimentary ride to Seattle!  I did not have the right change.  He also told me how to save a lot of money with the Regional Day Pass with Orca.  Not sure who all sees this but it was good info I wanted to pass along.</p>
<p>I love the class venue and think it is so great to get coffee.  I'm just wondering who gets the candy? I am very pleased with the day today because it was not overwhelming.  Sam, you are ingenious to keep it at a level we are comfortable with.  It helped me a lot to write the code and not get the dreaded beep I got so many times during my Java tutorial. It truly is so fun when your code works!  I met a couple great people and hope to meet more tomorrow and so on..</p>
