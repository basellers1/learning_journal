It is the end of day 3 and I am behind in my work.  It feels very discouraging.  One note to make is I tore a muscle in my rib cage last Friday and the pain is trying to override this great opportunity.  It takes me about 2 hours to get to and from class and I feel a bit crazy now as no time for anything.  I still have so much to read by tomorrow and no time to do any extra coding or fixing up my existing code.  I am sure it will get better. Yesterday, I was more confident.  It took me forever to fix yesterday's code and then to get today's lab working. I would have liked to get my page prettier and be able to practice the book lessons a little and look things up but at this point, I can only play catch up and keep up.  

To end with a positive note, I am enjoying the learning and the work and will look forward when I can grasp it further and do more in the little time we have in a day.
