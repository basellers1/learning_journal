Just now see the readings and journal were due this morning and not tonight.  I feel excited for very small moments because I get something accomplished and then "Boom", right back.  I was in lab until 6:20pm, getting home at 8pm, ate something and changed and it's 9pm already! !@@#$ :))  Then mess with the code, trying to figure out the lab today and need to read for a couple hours still.  I feel like I need these readings a lot so I try not to gloss over.  Tomorrow, up at 5am, ready for 30 minutes, then the 2 hour commute to school.  As far as the lab today, still not sure how the extra backend page ties in.  Maybe it's in the book.  I was happy to get my site deployed.  I think it's funny what big plans I have and my vision of the outcome and what ends up being the outcome.  Looking forward to those intertwining at some point.
