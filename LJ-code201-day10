It is the 3rd week. The wireframe exercise was somewhat successful.  Had some trouble with Github so that took up time and feel like I could use 10 more hours to study the css and take the time to handwrite it down first.  It is a bit a struggle to keep up and I do feel as if I get things but only after the fact when we are on the next thing.  I do not like this feeling of getting things 'almost' done.  I am adjusting however and trying to be kind to myself because I am here, learning and plugging away.
