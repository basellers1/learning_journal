"Today was a good day!" (Can you guess that musically reference?) I will be caught up again after turning this in and most importantly, I wrote some code that worked out, somewhat.  There will need to be changes but it is so exciting that I am getting the code better.  I think the Math.floor quiz question was very tricky as that sentence is not readily available by google search or book.  Well, I got tricked anyway.  You will see I got 8 out of 10 right, the same this time. :)  Looks like I am grasping a few things after all. I really want to do well.  I am sure getting my exercise walking 2-3 miles a day, depending on timing.  That is good because there will be no extra-curricular, non-coding activities for a while. Off to bed..
Oh, I got a message from GitHub saying my about_me did not deploy so I'll need to have a look at that again as well.
